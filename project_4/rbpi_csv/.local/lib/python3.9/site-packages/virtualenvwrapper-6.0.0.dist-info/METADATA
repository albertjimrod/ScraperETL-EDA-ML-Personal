virtualenvwrapper
#################

virtualenvwrapper is a set of extensions to Ian Bicking's `virtualenv
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ tool.  The extensions include
wrappers for creating and deleting virtual environments and otherwise
managing your development workflow, making it easier to work on more
than one project at a time without introducing conflicts in their
dependencies.

**Warning:** The 5.x release requires virtualenv 20+

========
Features
========

1.  Organizes all of your virtual environments in one place.

2.  Wrappers for creating, copying and deleting environments, including
    user-configurable hooks.

3.  Use a single command to switch between environments.

4.  Tab completion for commands that take a virtual environment as
    argument.

5. User-configurable hooks for all operations.

6. Plugin system for more creating sharable extensions.

Rich Leland has created a short `screencast
<https://vimeo.com/5894881>`__ showing off the features of
virtualenvwrapper.

============
Installation
============

See the `project documentation
<https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ for
installation and setup instructions.

Supported Shells
================

virtualenvwrapper is a set of shell *functions* defined in Bourne
shell compatible syntax.  It is tested under ``bash`` and
``zsh``.  It may work with other shells, so if you find that it does
work with a shell not listed here please let us know by opening a
`ticket on GitHub
<https://github.com/python-virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper/issues>`_.
If you can modify it to work with another shell, without completely
rewriting it, send a pull request through the `GitHub project page
<https://github.com/python-virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper/>`_.  If
you write a clone to work with an incompatible shell, let us know and
we will link to it from this page.

Python Versions
===============

virtualenvwrapper is tested under Python 3.8 - 3.11.

=======
Support
=======

Join the `virtualenvwrapper Google Group
<http://groups.google.com/group/virtualenvwrapper/>`__ to discuss
issues and features.

Report bugs via the `bug tracker on GitHub
<https://github.com/python-virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper/issues>`__.

Shell Aliases
=============

Since virtualenvwrapper is largely a shell script, it uses shell
commands for a lot of its actions.  If your environment makes heavy
use of shell aliases or other customizations, you may encounter
issues.  Before reporting bugs in the bug tracker, please test
*without* your aliases enabled.  If you can identify the alias causing
the problem, that will help make virtualenvwrapper more robust.
