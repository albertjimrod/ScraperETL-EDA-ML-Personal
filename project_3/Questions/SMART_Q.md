## Defining the problem we are trying to solve:
  
<br>


Embarking on the analysis of our dataset, we encounter a series of questions that will guide us towards a deep understanding of patterns and relationships within our data. These questions not only help us grasp surface-level details but also enable us to tackle more complex and varied problems.

The initial questions, such as the distribution of selling prices and the identification of top-selling brands, lead us to a range of activities involving prediction, categorization, visualization, and textual analysis. When examining how selling prices vary by geographic location, we delve into geographical analysis and the identification of spatial patterns.

Correlation analysis helps us uncover connections between the number of views and sales, as well as between selling price and geographic location. This leads us to find recurring patterns and themes in product descriptions through text analysis, revealing aspects that might go unnoticed at first glance.

Data segmentation allows us to categorize sellers, buyers, products, and cities based on their behavior and specific characteristics, leading to a deeper understanding of the underlying structure of our data. Finally, predictive modeling enables us to make predictions about future sales based on a variety of variables, from ad date to product characteristics and beyond.

This interconnection between the initial questions and the six types of problems we'll address in our analysis demonstrates how the richness of our dataset, encompassing both categorical and continuous data, allows us to explore and solve problems comprehensively. With this balance between different types of data, we are poised to gain a complete and holistic insight into our dataset and extract valuable information that will help us make informed and strategic decisions.

### These are the six types of problems that a data analyst encounters.

<br>


1. **Making predictions**:
   - **Predictive modeling**: Predictive modeling techniques can be used to anticipate sales based on variables such as ad date, product characteristics, geographic location, among others.

2. **Categorizing things**:
   - **Data segmentation**: Allows categorizing sellers or buyers into different segments based on their sales or purchasing behavior. Products or cities can also be categorized based on specific sales patterns.

3. **Showing something that is apparently not visible**:
   - **Text analysis**: It can reveal hidden patterns or common characteristics in product descriptions that may not be evident at first glance.

4. **Identifying themes**:
   - **Text analysis**: Enables identifying recurring themes or keywords in product descriptions that may influence sales.

5. **Discovering connections**:
   - **Correlation analysis**: Helps identify relationships between variables, such as the correlation between views and sales, or between selling price and geographic location.

6. **Finding patterns**:
   - **Temporal analysis and Geographical analysis**: Allow identifying temporal and spatial patterns in sales, such as seasonal trends, days of the week or months of higher sales activity, as well as sales patterns by geographic location.

In summary, each of the points you mentioned can be addressed using different data analysis techniques that can reveal valuable information and answer specific questions about the dataset.
