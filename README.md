## Project Description


This is the first part of the project:

- [from_web_to_csv](https://github.com/albertjimrod/personal_proj_hispasonic/blob/main/project_1/01_from_web_to_csv_togit.ipynb) : Process that I have followed for the **capture** and **cleaning** of data of the hispasonic website from scratch, I was advancing and understanding what path I should follow, discovering what library of functions and what strategies I should implement to condense that information of the ads in a file '*.csv'.

- [from_csv_database (PostgreSQL)](https://github.com/albertjimrod/personal_proj_hispasonic/blob/main/project_2/02_from_csv_to_PostgreSQL.ipynb) : In the context of a project, the initial phase of `ETL Extract Transform and Load` stands out for data loading into a specific database. This action lays the groundwork for effective data management, preparing it for future transformations and advanced analysis. Here I show in a very brief way what has been the process carried out to make it using `Jupyter` and `Python`.
