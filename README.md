## Project Description


This is the first part of the project:

- [from_web_to_csv](https://github.com/albertjimrod/personal_proj_hispasonic/blob/main/project_1/01_from_web_to_csv_togit.ipynb) : Process that I have followed for the **capture** and **cleaning** of data of the hispasonic website from scratch, I was advancing and understanding what path I should follow, discovering what library of functions and what strategies I should implement to condense that information of the ads in a file '*.csv'.
