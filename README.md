## Project Description


This is the first part of the project:

- [project_1 from_web_to_csv](https://github.com/albertjimrod/personal_proj_hispasonic/blob/main/project_1/01_from_web_to_csv_togit.ipynb) : Process that I have followed for the **capture** and **cleaning** of data of the hispasonic website from scratch, I was advancing and understanding what path I should follow, discovering what library of functions and what strategies I should implement to condense that information of the ads in a file '*.csv'.

- [project_2 from_csv_database (PostgreSQL)](https://github.com/albertjimrod/personal_proj_hispasonic/blob/main/project_2/02_from_csv_to_PostgreSQL.ipynb) : In the context of a project, the initial phase of `ETL Extract Transform and Load` stands out for data loading into a specific database. This action lays the groundwork for effective data management, preparing it for future transformations and advanced analysis. Here I show in a very brief way what has been the process carried out to make it using `Jupyter` and `Python`.

- [project_3 General guidelines in relation to the data obtained](https://github.com/albertjimrod/personal_proj_hispasonic/blob/main/project_3/Questions/SMART_Q.md): Beginning our dataset analysis, we're prompted with several inquiries guiding us towards a comprehensive comprehension of data patterns and relationships. These questions not only aid in grasping superficial details but also empower us to address intricate and diverse issues.

Starting with inquiries about price distributions and top-selling brands, we embark on predictive, categorization, visualization, and textual analysis endeavors. Exploring price variations across different regions delves us into geographic analysis and spatial pattern identification.
